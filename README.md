Lucene Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an educational project that contains examples demonstrating the use of features
of the Apache Lucene search library (http://lucene.apache.org). The examples were taken
from various sources (books, articles, forum posts, etc.) and adapted for the current
version of Lucene (7.5.0).
